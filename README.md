## Topics to learn

- Control structures (if statements, loops).
- Functions and modular programming.
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- List comprehensions.
- File handling.
- Exception handling.
- Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Practice and Review
- Spend some time on each practice day reviewing and refactoring previous code. Understand the importance of clean and readable code.
- Join online coding platforms to share your code and get feedback.
- Ask your questions on StackOverFlow.
- Implement small projects using OOP concepts.
- Practice NumPy by working with numerical data.
- Code simple programs using the concepts learned.
- Explore coding challenges on platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode.

## Additional Resources
